Problem #25 
What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?

Problem #16 
2^15 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26. What is the sum of the digits of the number 2^1000?

Problem #20 
n! means n × (n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1
For example, 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800, and the sum of the digits in the number 10! 
is 3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27.
